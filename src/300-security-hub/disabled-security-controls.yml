  ### Controls that deal with CloudTrail logging
  ####### 

  # This control deals with using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt AWS CloudTrail trail logs. 
  # If you log these trails in a centralized logging account, you only need to enable this control in the account 
  # and Region where centralized logging takes place.

  # [CloudTrail.2] CloudTrail should have encryption at-rest enabled

    Properties:

      ControlStatus: DISABLED
      DisabledReason: This control is disabled outside the primary region in the logging account as it results in false positives

  #######
  ### Controls that deal with global resources
  ####### 

  # To save on the cost of AWS Config, you can disable recording of global resources in all but one AWS Region. 
  # After you do this, AWS Security Hub will still run security checks in all Regions where controls are enabled 
  # and will charge you based on the number of checks per account per Region. Accordingly, to save on the cost of Security Hub, 
  # disable the following controls that deal with global resources in all Regions except the Region that records global resources.
  #
  # If you disable these controls and disable recording of global resources in particular Regions,
  # you should also disable [Config.1] AWS Config should be enabled in those Regions. 
  # This is because Config.1 requires recording of global resources in order to pass.
